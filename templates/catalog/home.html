            <h2>The Alternative Course Finder</h2>
            <p>Let's face it - ASU is a very large school. With <a href="https://asunews.asu.edu/20130822-ASU-record-students" title="Record number of students choose ASU ">
                over 76,000 students</a>, class registration is difficult for both administrators and students. During enrollment, students are often faced with sluggish performance on ASU's own 
                <a href="https://webapp4.asu.edu/catalog/" title="ASU Class Search">class search utility</a> and occasionally find that classes they are interested in have already been filled.
                That's where this website comes in: roughly every 20 minutes our server clones the entire publicly available course catalog, indexes what it finds and makes it available for you to use. Because
                we store only information you care about as a student, searches are fast and allow a level of precision not available elsewhere. Further, with so many students seats open and close for classes all
                of the time and we're among the first to know when it happens! Our free service will notify you when seats open in any class you wish to track.
            </p>
            <h2>Updates</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>9-24-13 - All catalog updates and development efforts have ceased. Running the server out of home was 
                  using too much bandwidth to sustain and usage statistics were poor. My eventual plan is to port this work
                  to a client application rather than a hosted solution. It's been a good run, and I appreciate the assistance
                  and tips provided by Facebook friends.</li>
                <li>8-1-13 - Live again! While more effort than expected, everything is in order. Taking all this trouble
                  ASU has given me as a sign, I've backed off even further on connection frequency, now taking upwards of
                  a half hour per cycle. However, as I said in the FAQ, messages are sent out as soon as the data is available
                  for the class you are interested in, so this doesn't make too much difference. I'm presently researching
                  alternative strategies to eventually bring this time down.</li>
                <li>7-29-13 - Not even 2 days of complete running and I've been foiled again. I'm extremely curious
                  how they're distinguishing my requests from legitimate browsers, but I feel like there is an
                  obvious solution: stop falsifying web-browsers. With tools like Selenium, I can generate truly
                  indistinguishable requests. Short of indiscriminately  banning entire IP blocks, I see no mechanism
                  for filtering my requests. If, for some reason, ASU is reading this - in case it wasn't obvious,
                  doing so would not be wise (and it would be impossible to keep up anyways).</li>
                <li>7-28-13 - We are back and running! A handful of email and dashboard bugs have been corrected,
                  with more fixes to come. While still technically in "beta", it seems stable enough to be used.
                  We will continue to improve in the coming weeks.</li>
                <li>7-27-13 - The new cataloging system is presently being tested. There were a few unexpected
                  difficulties, notably that Amazon's default EC2 images don't allow executing administrative
                  commands automatically by default. We are seeing huge improvements in cataloging times though,
                  so stay tuned. The goal is to have a fully working notification system in place for the week prior
                  to courses starting, since this is typically the time of highest use for websites such as this.
                  Special thanks to friends on Facebook for their suggestions and testing.</li>
                <li>7-21-13 - As of last Friday, updates to the catalog have been temporarily ceased. ASU 
                  decided it would be in their best interest to block my server from accessing the catalog
                  which, while not entirely unexpected, came as a surprise. I'm about halfway through
                  altering the catalog spider to utilize cloud servers, thus making it nearly impossible
                  for ASU to systematically detect and block our service. We're also taking this as an
                  opportunity to make the entire website more robust against the bugs that have been reported</li>
                <li>7/15/13 - Back at it. Made the search form more intuitive: options are preserved for
                  convenience, and week days no longer need to be selected. Paging is now enabled on the 
                  results viewer, so queries larger than 100 results can be used more effectively. Empty
                  result sets no longer present a table containing a single blank row.</li>
                <li>7/4/13 - Enabled site-wide hiding of search bar. All pages are valid XHTML 1.0 Strict. 
                  Catalog spidering has resumed, though there are still a few lingering bugs. </li>
                <li>7/3/13 - Tracking in place, though untested. All links
                  are now valid pages and design is consistent throughout the entire
                  website. Search by day of week now fully functional.</li>
                <li>6/30/13 - Added Registration... tracking coming soon</li>
                <li>6/25/13 - This Just In - New Design!</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Coming Soon</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Email/SMS notifications should properly identify which course was found, rather than
                  just providing a generic message.</li>
                <li>Need to provide class level aliases, eg: Upper Division, Graduate, Lower Division, etc...</li>
                <li>Results page should notify user of reserved seating hazards. This is tracked internally,
                  but the details don't make it to the end-user yet.</li>
            </ul>
